# Quito Seguro iOS

Quito Seguro is an app designed and developed for Quito - Ecuador citizens who care about their security.

Quito Seguro allows users to visually identify dangerous city areas. Completely user-curated, citizens can point safe areas to move around the city avoiding the ones with more report density.

Users can also report incidents that have happened in the city in a completely anonymous way, thus helping other app users with their reports. Users can send reports hourly.

A stats section is also included where all offenses are quantified to identify the more common ones.

There is also a Security Tips section, with small articles and tips written by an well-known security expert. This content will be updated on a weekly basis.
